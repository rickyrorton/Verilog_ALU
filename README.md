# 74LS181 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - Verilog Implementation
## Overview

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of the 74LS181 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The 74LS181 is a versatile, high-speed, 4-bit ALU designed to perform various arithmetic and logic operations.

## Features

1. Supports 16 arithmetic and logic functions.
2. 4-bit parallel operation.
3. Designed for high-speed digital computations.
4. Tested and verified functionalities.

## Contents

1. alu.v: Verilog source file containing the ALU implementation.
2. alu_tb.v: Verilog testbench file for functional verification.
3. README.md: This readme file providing an overview of the project.
